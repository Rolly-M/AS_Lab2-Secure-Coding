# Proposed Overall Hardenings

1. Hash collision resolution: 

Implement a hash collision resolution mechanism, such as chaining or open addressing, 
to ensure efficient performance even with a large number of entries in the hash map.

2. Input validation: 

Validate the input to the functions to ensure that they are not passed invalid or malicious data, 
such as a key string of excessively long length.

3. Use Cryptographic Hashes: 

To securely store sensitive data, cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-256 or bcrypt can be used.

4. Use Safe String Libraries: 

Use safe string libraries that help prevent buffer overflow attacks, such as strlcpy or snprintf instead of strcpy or sprintf.

5. Avoid Hardcoded Values: 

Avoid using hardcoded values for important parameters like MAP_MAX, as they can be easily exploited.

6. Implement Memory Management: 

Ensure that all memory resources are properly managed and freed when no longer needed to prevent memory leaks or buffer overflows.

7. Perform Regular Code Reviews: 

Regularly review the code to ensure that it's secure and free of vulnerabilities.

8. Use Encryption: 

Encrypt sensitive data to protect it from from been read in case of successfull buffer overflow.


My fixes aim to eliminate problems by targeting the specific issues that were identified in each case. Take for instance, the use of strcpy instead of strcmp. 
The fix replaces the string comparison function to verify equality, instead of copying one string to another, thereby preventing the risk of buffer overflow and related security concerns. 
Similarly, other fixes target memory allocation, data validation, and input handling, making the code more secure and reducing its vulnerability to attacks or security breaches.

Also, Here are some hardening techniques that could be implemented at the OS level or host machine on which program is to be ran:

- Enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR): This is a technique that randomizes the location of code and data in memory. 
  This makes it more difficult for attackers to execute code or exploit buffer overflows as the location of the target is not predictable.
  is enabled by default on most recent versions of Ubuntu, but it can be manually enabled or disabled using the sysctl command.
  

- Enable Data Execution Prevention (DEP): This is a technique that marks certain pages of memory as non-executable. This helps prevent attackers from exploiting buffer overflows or similar 
  vulnerabilities by executing code in a region of memory that is not intended for code execution. DEP is enabled by default on most recent versions of Ubuntu, but it can be manually enabled 
  or disabled using the sysctl command.

- Implement access controls: Ensure that the program is running with the least privilege necessary, and restrict access to sensitive information or functionality to only those who need it.
  Access controls can be set using the built-in sudo and chmod commands, as well as by configuring permissions in the file system.

- Limit the resources available to the program: You can use resource limits to limit the amount of memory, CPU time, and other resources that the program can use. 
  This can help prevent resource exhaustion attacks and prevent the program from monopolizing system resources. This can be set in the /etc/security/limits.conf with the 'ulimit' command
