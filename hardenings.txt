# Proposed Hardenings for hash.c

1. Hash collision resolution: 

Implement a hash collision resolution mechanism, such as chaining or open addressing, 
to ensure efficient performance even with a large number of entries in the hash map.

2. Input validation: 

Validate the input to the functions to ensure that they are not passed invalid or malicious data, 
such as a key string of excessively long length.

3. Use Cryptographic Hashes: 

To securely store sensitive data, cryptographic hash functions such as SHA-256 or bcrypt can be used.

4. Use Safe String Libraries: 

Use safe string libraries that help prevent buffer overflow attacks, such as strlcpy or snprintf instead of strcpy or sprintf.

5. Avoid Hardcoded Values: 

Avoid using hardcoded values for important parameters like MAP_MAX, as they can be easily exploited.

6. Implement Memory Management: 

Ensure that all memory resources are properly managed and freed when no longer needed to prevent memory leaks or buffer overflows.

7. Perform Regular Code Reviews: 

Regularly review the code to ensure that it's secure and free of vulnerabilities.

8. Use Encryption: 

Encrypt sensitive data to protect it from from been read in case of successfull buffer overflow.
